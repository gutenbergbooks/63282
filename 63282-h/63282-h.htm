<p>Drapery fabrics are available to us
today in an overwhelming variety
for every decor&mdash;not only in the
traditional fabrics, but also in the
many new synthetics and blends.</p>
<p>Whether the room is traditional,
modern, formal or informal, you
need only visit the drapery fabric
department to realize what a wide
choice of fabrics are available in
either group.</p>
<p>Windows are so much a part of the
background that the fabric chosen,
its texture, color and line, and the
design of the curtains, draperies
and slip covers must be in keeping
with the atmosphere of the room
and contribute to the over-all effect.</p>
<p>For the very formal treatment,
you&rsquo;ll want to choose something in
the Damask designs, taffetas, moires,
brocades, satins, brocatelles or
the many blends of the pure and
man-made fibers, some with metallic
threads woven in. Fringes and
tassels are used as trims, and the
window treatment would include
draped valances, swags, cascades,
elaborate cornices, tie-backs, etc.</p>
<p>For the less formal or informal
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
room, the choice of fabric is even
wider&mdash;linens in medium and sheer
weights, prints and lacey patterns,
marquisette, scrim, voile, ninon,
denim, sailcloth, chintz, polished
cotton, antique satin, organdy, batiste
and many blends of synthetics,
such as Fortisan and rayon or silk.
The curtain treatment should be
simple. If valances are used, they
should be plain with straight lines.</p>
<p>Many of the new synthetic fibers
are a real advantage to the home-maker
because of their easy washing
and quick drying properties.
Some require very little pressing,
if any.</p>
<p>In estimating the yardage required,
consider the length of the drapery,
before finishing hems and heading,
and the width of the window or
space to be covered. An allowance
of 2&frac12; or 3 times the width should
be made for fullness. When using
sheer fabrics, draperies should be
full enough to hang in easy, graceful
folds. Over-curtains or draperies
of medium weight fabrics require
a fullness of 2 to 2&frac12; times the
width. Also, if you select a fabric
with a large one-way design, some
allowance should be made for
matching the design so all lengths
will balance.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For example:</i></span> The window is 64&Prime;
wide which requires 4 widths of
48&Prime; wide fabric for a 3 to 1 fullness.
The drapery lengths are 2&#8531;
yards long. If a plain fabric or overall
design is used, the fabric required
would be 9&#8531; yards, but if
the fabric has a 24&Prime; repeat pattern,
you must allow 1&#8531; yards more, or
a total of 10&#8532; yards for matching
the design.</p>
<p>Consider the width of the fabric
when figuring the number of widths
for fullness. Some fabrics are only
36&Prime; wide&mdash;chintz and some polished
cottons, for example. Others may
run 40&Prime;&mdash;48&Prime;&mdash;even 54&Prime; or 60&Prime; in
width; but the average is about
48&Prime; wide.</p>

<p class="pcap">Grain lines of fabric.</p>
</div>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt>&lArr;Crosswise Grain&mdash;Weft or Filling&rArr;</dt>
<dt>&lArr;Lengthwise Grain&mdash;Warp&rArr;</dt>
<dt>&lArr;True Bias&rArr;</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Draperies must be cut on the true
lengthwise and crosswise grain of
the fabric so that when hung, they
fall straight from the rod in even,
graceful folds.</p>
<p>In weaving, yarns are threaded
lengthwise on a loom which form
the warp of the fabric. Another
yarn is interlaced back and forth
crosswise and is called the weft or
filling thread. This is known as the
plain weave. Linen, voile, chintz,
etc., are a few of the plain woven
fabrics. There are variations of the
plain weave, such as the pile weave,
with velveteen and corduroy as examples.
The basket weave is another,
with Monk&rsquo;s cloth as an
example. The diagonal line halfway
between the lengthwise and crosswise
threads is the bias of the fabric.</p>
<p>The twill weave is perhaps one of
the most durable. The filling yarn
forms a diagonal line, passing over
one warp yarn and under two or
more. Denim, drill cloth and ticking
are examples of this weave.</p>
<p>The satin weave is an irregular
weave where one yarn passes over
several yarns of the other set before
interweaving, forming a floating,
lustrous surface.</p>
<p>Weaves are used in combinations to
obtain the various patterns in Damasks,
brocades, Jacquards, etc.</p>

<p class="pcap">Cutting on true crosswise grain.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The yarns made from the different
fibers&mdash;the natural, man-made and
blended fibers&mdash;are of various sizes,
weights, smoothness and fuzziness.
The type of yarns used in the different
weaves influences the texture of
the fabric as well as its weight,
lustre and durability.</p>
<p>When cutting drapery lengths, be
sure to start with a true crosswise
grain. Most firmly woven plain
weave fabrics can be torn. Snip the
selvage before you tear the fabric.
Linens, loosely woven and nubby
fabrics, novelty weaves and many
others will not tear satisfactorily.
To straighten these, it is necessary
to pull a thread crosswise and cut
on pulled line.</p>
<p>After cutting lengths, check to see
if the ends of the fabric are square.
If not, square the crosswise edge
by pulling the low corner on a
true bias from opposite side of the
fabric. Sometimes dampening the
fabric will relax the threads and
make straightening easier.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Color and Design</i></span></h2>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="500" height="483" />
</div>
<p>Color has a language all its own&mdash;It
expresses, it soothes, it stimulates,
it creates; it can give you a lift.
And color as a home decorator can
be made to work like magic. With
color, the dullest rooms can be made
to sparkle with warmth and good
cheer. Any color scheme is good as
long as it is balanced and it pleases
you. A number of colors, tints and
shades may be used in one room,
but one color should be dominant
and it should be used in different
areas of the room. The second color
should be subordinate, not of the
same value. Then a third color may
be used for accent or contrast. The
neutral colors: gray, white and
black, are good background or accent
colors.</p>
<p>Do not overlook the possibilities of
accessories, such as pillows, vases,
china, lamps and books to supply
an accent color to complete your
color scheme.</p>
<p>Your color scheme may be taken
from a favorite picture, a family
heirloom or may express the interests
and personalities of the family.
Consider also the location of the
room&mdash;East, West, North or South&mdash;and
how the light enters the room.</p>
<p>There are three primary colors&mdash;red,
yellow and blue. These colors
are mixed to obtain secondary
colors. For example, red and yellow
produce the color orange; red and
blue, the color violet and blue and
yellow, the color green. By blending
these six colors we complete the
color wheel which is made up of
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
red, red orange, orange, yellow,
yellow green, green, blue green,
blue, blue violet and violet.</p>
<p>We refer to certain colors as warm,
others as cool and still others as
neither warm nor cool. The warm
colors are red, yellow and orange.
The cool colors are the blues. Green
is neither warm nor cool but if
mixed with yellow, it becomes
warm; when mixed with blue, it
becomes a cool color.</p>
<p>Color and line apparently change
the size of the room. Cool, light
colors and vertical lines make walls
appear higher and the room larger,
while warm colors and horizontal
lines seem to lower the ceiling and
draw the walls nearer.</p>
<p>For North and East rooms, use
warm colors. If little light enters
in, use light shades of the warm
colors. Use the cool colors in rooms
with South or West exposures.</p>
<p>When purchasing your fabrics for
curtains, draperies and slip covers,
keep in mind the overall effect.
Consider the room exposure, light,
size of room, furniture arrangement
and what color and design
will do to create a room you will
always enjoy. Since windows are
a very important part of the room
as a unit, the fabric chosen for
curtains or draperies should also
be used to slip cover a sofa or chair,
a dressing table cover, or a dust
ruffle for the bed.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p05.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="500" height="215" />
</div>
<h3 id="c3"><i>Selection of Needles and Thread</i></h3>
<p>Sewing thread should blend as
nearly as possible with the fabric
in color, fiber and size. Silk and
wool fabrics are stitched with silk
thread. Cottons, linens and some
blended fabrics are stitched with
cotton thread or mercerized thread.
The synthetic fabrics and blends of
the pure and man-made fibers may
be stitched with silk, mercerized
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
cotton, nylon or Dacron (DuPont)
thread. The needle is selected with
consideration to both the thread
and the fabric.</p>
<p>With fabrics used for glass curtains
and for sheer curtains, such as
organdy, voile, &ldquo;Dacron,&rdquo; dotted
Swiss, marquisettes, batiste and
sheer linen, use a fine cotton thread,
size 80 or 90, or a mercerized
thread. Use a size 14 needle for
mercerized thread and a size 11 for
finer threads, including &ldquo;Dacron&rdquo;
for &ldquo;Dacron&rdquo; fabrics, organdy,
&ldquo;Dacron,&rdquo; marquisette, dotted
Swiss, lawn, batiste and rayon lend
themselves beautifully to the use of
sewing machine attachments for
ruffling, tucking, hemming, etc.
Fiberglas stitches well and is best
suited to straight panel type curtains
with pleated headings. Use a
mercerized thread and size 14 machine
needle for Fortisan, synthetics
and the many blends.</p>
<p>The average machine stitch length
for these fabrics should be about
12 stitches to the inch and the tensions
easy enough to prevent puckering
the fabrics, particularly sheer
fabrics, such as batiste, nylons,
ninons and soft rayon blends.</p>
<p>For Damask, brocades, taffetas,
satins, etc., use silk or mercerized
thread, size 14 or 11 needles of 12
to 14 stitches per inch.</p>
<p>Heavy weight fabrics, namely,
linens, cotton Damasks, sailcloth,
ticking, denims, etc., require a
heavy-duty thread, a size 16 needle
and a 12 stitch length.</p>
<p>For light or medium weight fabrics
comparable to polished cottons,
Chintz, linens, Glosheen, percale,
antique satin and faille, use a mercerized
thread, a size 14 needle and
a 12 or 14 stitch length.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small"><i>Window Measurements</i></span></h2>
<p>Before taking measurements, there
are several points that should be
taken into consideration: Is the
window in proportion to the room?
Will it contribute properly to the
effect you wish to achieve? Do you
have the right rods for hanging the
type of drapery selected?</p>
<p>When you are satisfied with the window,
then it is time to consider the
type of materials for draperies and
decide on the type of rod required.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to make a sketch
of the room, noting the placement
of windows and arrangement of
furniture. Also take the width and
height measurement of each window.
Then visit the curtain and drapery
department to get an idea of
the type of fixtures available. At
the same time, obtain small samples
of the fabrics suited to the type of
drapery you have in mind. Examine
them in the room where they are to
be used. Are they the right texture?
Are the colors lively enough? Will
they create the desired effect?</p>
<p>Purchase and mount the rods for
the draperies. Fixtures should be
mounted so that draperies, when
hung, will cover the window frame.
Now you are ready to take measurements.</p>
<p>There are three correct lengths for
draperies&mdash;to the sill&mdash;to the lower
edge of the apron&mdash;or to the floor.
Full length draperies should just
clear the floor or be long enough
to crush on the floor.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For length</i></span>&mdash;Measure from the top
of the rod down&mdash;to the sill&mdash;to the
lower edge of apron&mdash;or to the floor.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For width</i></span>&mdash;Measure from edge to
edge of window frame or from outer
edges of fixture brackets. To this
measurement add the &ldquo;return&rdquo; at
either end; that is, the length from
curve of rod to the wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h4>Estimating Yardage for Over-Curtains or Draperies</h4>
<p>The type of heading, the width of
lower hem and the type of drapery;
that is, lined, unlined or interlined,
must be considered when estimating
the yardage required. The fullness
of draperies averages about
twice the width of the space to be
covered.</p>
<p>A stiffening; such as a strip of crinoline
or buckram is used at the top
to support the pleats.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For Lined Draperies</i></span>&mdash;To length
measurement, add 1&Prime; for heading,
4&Prime; for hem and 3&frac12;&Prime; for bottom
hem.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>Example</i></span>&mdash;If length from top of rod
is 90&Prime;, add 1&Prime; plus 4&Prime; plus 3&frac12;&Prime;.
This equals 98&frac12;&Prime; for one length,
or 5&frac12; yards for the two lengths.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For Unlined Draperies</i></span>&mdash;To length
measurement, add 1&Prime; for heading,
4&frac12;&Prime; for top hem and seam, and
3&frac12;&Prime; for lower hem. A 4&Prime; wide strip
of crinoline is used at the top of
both lined and unlined drapes.</p>
<p>If a double hem is used at the bottom,
then add 6&Prime; instead of 3&frac12;&Prime;
for hem in either lined or unlined
drapes.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For Interlined Draperies</i></span>&mdash;To
length measurement, add 1&Prime; for
heading, 3&Prime; for top hem and 3&Prime; for
bottom hem.</p>
<p>When using ready-made headings
for pleats, add to the length measurement
1&frac12;&Prime; for heading and
seam, and 3&frac12;&Prime; for bottom hem.</p>

<p class="pcap"><i>French Doors or Window</i></p>
<p class="pcapc">The rod should be placed so that the drapery,
when hung, covers the glass portion of the window.
Take measurement from top of upper rod to
lower part of lower rod. To this measurement,
add 2&frac12;&Prime; at the top and 2&frac12;&Prime; at the bottom. This
allows for a 1&frac12;&Prime; hem, top and bottom, plus &frac14;&Prime;
seam allowance. The 1&frac12;&Prime; hem is for a &frac34;&Prime; casing
and &frac34;&Prime; heading.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07f.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="272" height="314" />
</div>
<p>When draperies are hung flush with the wall,
measurements are taken inside the recess. A
spring socket type of fixture is available for this
type of window. Always measure from the top of
the rod, except for Cafe curtains. Usually a ring,
&ldquo;sew-on&rdquo; or &ldquo;clip-on&rdquo; type is used. In this case,
measure from lower part of circle to lower part
of next section, or to the sill. Add depth of top
finish plus hem to this measurement.</p>

<p>These windows are usually treated as one. Draperies,
in two sections, are hung on a pole or traverse
rod and are drawn to the center, one section
overlapping the other about 2&Prime;. Take length
measurement from top of rod to the floor. To this
measurement, add 5&frac12;&Prime; for heading and top hem
and 3&frac12;&Prime; for bottom hem. If double hems are
used, add 9&Prime; at the top plus 6&Prime; for bottom hem.
To the width, add 3&Prime; at either end for return of
curtain from fixture to wall.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07g.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="495" height="593" />

<p>To permit ease when opening or closing the window,
the fixture should extend a little beyond
the window on either side. Use a simple fixture,
an oval or round rod, and a draw type of drapery.
If drapery is to be shirred on the rod, take measurement
from top of rod to lower edge of window.
To length measurement, add 2&frac12;&Prime; for a 1&frac12;&Prime;
hem which forms the casing and heading, and
2&frac34;&Prime; to 2&frac12;&Prime; bottom hem. If <i>sew-on</i> or <i>clip-on
rings are used, measure</i> from lower circle of ring
to edge of window. To this measurement, add
depth of top and bottom hem.</p>

<h4>Awning Window</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p08.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="516" height="649" />
</div>
<p>The type of drapery determines points of measurement.
With tier type draperies, one for each
section of the window, the measurements are
taken from top to bottom of each section. Draperies
hung from the top extending to lower edge
of window or floor are measured from top of fixture
for length desired. Tier type or cafe sections
should be long enough to overlap the heading of
the section below. Follow same procedure for
measuring as for projected window. These draperies
should be full&mdash;1&frac12; times the width for medium
weight fabrics, such as Chintz, Glosheen,
etc., to three times the width when using sheer
fabrics.</p>
<h4>Methods of installing</h4>
<p>Curtain and drapery rods, brackets
and valance boards should be mounted
securely to the wall to support
heavy draperies. This can be a problem
unless you use the right screws
or bolts. There is a correct screw and
bolt available for every type of wall&mdash;brick,
concrete or plaster walls.</p>

<p>Draperies or over curtains are made
of medium weight or heavy fabrics.
They may be unlined, lined or lined
and interlined, depending on the
fabric and its treatment&mdash;whether
formal or informal.</p>
<p>There are three accepted lengths
for draperies&mdash;to the window sill&mdash;to
the bottom of the window apron&mdash;or
to the floor. Floor length is
most generally used, and for very
formal treatments, the drapery is
often made long enough to crush
on the floor. Draperies hang straight
from the rod to the floor. If they
meet at the top center, they may be
draped to either side and held with
ornamental tie-backs or those made
of the same material.</p>
<p>When the type and design of draperies
have been decided upon and
the right type of rods have been
mounted, then measurements for
draperies can be taken.</p>
<p>Measure from the top of the rod
down for length desired. Then add
to length measurement the allowance
for top and bottom hems. Review
chapter on &ldquo;Fabrics&rdquo; before
cutting lengths for draperies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h4><span id="unlined">Unlined Draperies</span></h4>
<p>These draperies are informal in
treatment and are usually made of
light or medium weight fabrics.
Most any type of top finish, shirring
or pleats is suitable. A plain
valance or cornice board may be
used. For a pleated heading, allow
5&frac12;&Prime; at the top for heading and
5&frac12;&Prime; at the bottom for a 2&frac12;&Prime; double
hem. Cut strips of crinoline or
lawn for stiffening 4&Prime; wide and 3&Prime;
shorter than the width of each drapery
length. Pin strip to underside
of heading &frac12;&Prime; from the top, starting

<dt>LINING</dt>
<dt>3&Prime;</dt>
<dt>2&Prime;</dt></dl>
<p>Draperies are lined for the protection
of the fabric. Linings also give
weight to the draperies, causing
them to hang in deeper folds. A sun-fast
white, soft gray or cream colored
sateen is generally used as the
lining fabric.</p>
<p>Linings, just as drapery fabrics,
must be cut straight with the crosswise
and lengthwise grains.</p>
<p>Always start with a straight crosswise
edge. This is obtained by drawing
a crosswise thread and cutting
on drawn thread. If fabric slopes
up on one edge, then it should be
straightened before pieces are cut.</p>
<p>Very often, when fabrics are rolled
on the boards at the mills, the fabric
is rolled more tightly on one end
than at the other, drawing the
crosswise threads (weft) in a diagonal
line. This is apt to be true in
loosely woven fabrics and particularly
lining fabric.</p>
<p>To straighten fabric, first remove
selvages, pull fabric gently but
effectively, stretching it diagonally
from corner to corner; then alternate.
Grasp the fabric so that you
will neither injure nor wrinkle it.
Press before seaming.</p>
<p>Lining should be cut to allow for a
2&Prime; hem at the bottom and a &frac12;&Prime;
seam across the top and sides.</p>
<p>Illustration is for a drapery 2&frac12;
yards long, finished with 4&Prime; top
hem, 1&Prime; side hems and 3&Prime; bottom
hem. Drapery length would measure
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
98&frac12;&Prime; and lining length, 88&frac12;&Prime;.
The average hem widths, 3&Prime; and
4&Prime;, were used in figuring measurements.
The width of hems vary.
There is no fixed rule. They may be
3&Prime;&mdash;4&Prime;&mdash;5&Prime; or even 7&Prime; at the top
and 2&Prime;&mdash;2&frac12;&Prime;&mdash;3&Prime; or 4&Prime; at the bottom.
In many cases the bottom hem
is doubled, particularly in sheer
or lightweight fabrics. Also the
center side hem may be as much as
2&Prime; wide and the outer hem 1&Prime;. In
this case, the lining is cut 6&Prime; narrower
than the drapery. Before taking
measurements for draperies, review
section on <a class="htm" href="#c4"><i>Window Measurements</i></a>.</p>
<p>To join lining, turn top edge of lining
to underside &frac12;&Prime; and press. Pin
lining and drapery together, starting
7&frac12;&Prime; from the top. Stitch from
top of lining down to 4&frac12;&Prime; of lower
edge of lining, taking a &frac12;&Prime; seam.
Back-stitch at the beginning and
end of seam. Press seam as stitched;
then clip seam every 3&Prime; or 4&Prime;. Press
the seam open. Pin, from hem to
hem, a 4&Prime; wide strip of stiffening
to underside across the top. Stitch
and press.</p>

Then adjust length of drapery so
that it clears the rug or floor. Turn

is made for a 2&Prime; hem with &frac12;&Prime; for
seam. The lining hem hangs free
of the curtain and is held in position

12&Prime; apart. To french tack, take 3
or 4 stitches first at top of drapery
hem, then lining hem, then drapery
hem, etc., leaving a &frac12;&Prime; or &frac34;&Prime; length

<p>When using a tape with woven-in
pockets for pleater pins, allow 2&Prime;
above the rod for heading and
seam. See instructions under the
section <a class="htm" href="#unlined"><i>Unlined Draperies</i></a> for joining
tape to heading. Join lining;
then clip and press seams. Turn
drapery to right side and pin lining
to bottom of tape, overlapping &frac14;&Prime;.
Stitch and press; then finish side
hems above lining by hand.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to tack the side
hems along stitching line. This prevents
them from slipping and hems
always appear sharper. Using
matching thread and working from
the underside, insert needle through
the seam down through to the right
side, picking up a thread or two of
the fabric. Then bring needle back
up through the seam. Insert needle
at the same point and direct needle
along the seam between the hem a
distance of 1&Prime;. Bring needle up
through seam; then direct needle
down through seam at same point,
picking up two or three threads,
and then up through seam again.
Continue this tacking the length of
the hem.</p>
<h4>Drapery lined to top</h4>
<p>There are times that draperies are
lined to the top instead of using a
hem, particularly when a valance or
cornice board is used. To the length
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
measurement, add 1&frac12;&Prime; at the top
for heading and seam. Cut lining in
proportion. Stitch lining and drapery
lengths together, bringing
edges even at the top. Clip seam and
press open. Cut stiffening the length
of drapery width. Pin and stitch
stiffening across the top, taking &frac12;&Prime;
seam. Turn drapery right side out,
enclosing heading. Press top and
side hems. Finish hems at the bottom
the same as for lined draperies.</p>

<h4>Interlined Draperies</h4>
<p>Draperies are often interlined, particularly
in very formal rooms, or
when the character of the material
is such that the extra weight is necessary
for its protection. Interlining
also adds to the draping quality
and elegance of the fabric.</p>
<p>For an interlining fabric, use good
quality cotton flannel. Cut interlining
the exact measurements of draperies
when finished; that is, if draperies
have 1&frac12;&Prime; hems on each side
and 3&Prime; hems, top and bottom, then
cut interlining 3&Prime; narrower and 6&Prime;
shorter than drapery fabric. Spread
material right side down.</p>

<div class="img">
<img src="images/p14.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="600" height="201" />
</div>
<p>The use of pleats is one of the most
effective ways of controlling the
fullness of a drapery that is made
to hang in balanced, graceful folds.
The types most generally used are
the pinch pleat, the French pleat,
the box pleat and the cartridge
pleat.</p>
<p>Pleats should be made in groups of
uneven numbers, 5-7-9, or as many
as are required to take up the
amount allowed for fullness. For
very sheer fabrics, the allowance
for fullness should be 3 times the
width of the window or space to be
covered. To figure the spacings and
amount to be taken up in pleats,
take the measurement of the space
to be covered plus the return; that
is, the distance from turn of rod to
the wall or the bracket supporting
the rod on either end, plus the
overlap at the center when curtains
are drawn together. The width allowed
for draperies minus these
three measurements is to be taken
up in pleats.</p>
<p>The fullness of each type of pleat
and space between depends on the
weight of the material and amount
allowed for fullness of the curtain.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>For Example</i></span>: If one half of the
width to be covered is 49&Prime; then one
section of the drapery would be
about 144&Prime; wide after finishing side
hems. To width of window area
(49&Prime;), add 3&Prime; for return and 1&Prime;
for center overlap. This totals 53&Prime;.
144&Prime; minus 53&Prime; equals 91&Prime; for
pleats. Allowing 7&Prime; for each pleat,
13 pleats will be required to take
up the fullness.</p>
<p>Please Note&mdash;3&Prime; for return is used
as an example. The return can be
4&Prime; or 5&Prime;, depending on type of rod
or bracket. Always measure the return.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h4>Steps to Pleats</h4>
<p>Always measure and mark the exact
position and width for all pleats
and spacings before stitching.</p>
<p>Measure the width of the return
from outer edge. Then measure for
the first pleat at the curve of the
rod. Place second pleat on opposite
side 2&Prime; from center edge. The third
pleat is placed at the exact center
between the first and second pleat.
The remaining number of pleats required
is evenly spaced between
the 1st and 3rd and between the
2nd and 3rd pleats. To form pleats,
bring markings for pleats together.
Pin; then stitch from top to &frac34;&Prime;
below the heading, reversing the
stitch at either end.</p>

as Fortisan blends, antique satin,
taffetas and sheer linens are suitable
for these curtains.</p>
<p>Measure from top of rod to floor
for length. Add 9&frac12;&Prime; at top for
seam, loops, and facing and 6&Prime; for
a 3&Prime; double bottom hem. Allow 3
times the width of space to be covered
for fullness.</p>
<p><span class="ss"><i>Example</i></span>: If space to be covered is
52&Prime;, 3 lengths of 48&Prime; fabric are
required. Cut one length through
center and join each half width to
each one of the full widths. Each
section measures approximately
70&Prime;. 70&Prime; minus 4&Prime; for 1&Prime; double
hems and 3&Prime; for return equals 63&Prime;.

<h4>Tie-Backs</h4>
<p>Fabric tie-backs for draperies are
usually tailored, straight or shaped
bands which match or harmonize
with the drapery in color and design.
The fullness of the drapery determines
the length of the tie-back. To
estimate length, loop a strip of material
around the drapery, drawing
it back to side of window for the
best effect. Lengths may vary from
18&Prime; to 24&Prime; and can be 2&frac12;&Prime; or more
in width. They are usually lined or
faced and interlined. Use a stiffening
of heavy muslin or crinoline in
a shaped band. For shaped band,
cut a paper pattern about 3&Prime; or 4&Prime;
wide in the center, tapering to 2&Prime;
or 2&frac12;&Prime; at the end as illustrated.
Cut fabric, lining and stiffening the
same as pattern, allowing for a &#8540;&Prime;
seam on all edges.</p>
<p>Pin stiffening to underside of band,
and lining to right side of material&mdash;right
sides together. Stitch, leaving
an opening of 3&Prime; or 4&Prime; for
turning.</p>
<p>Trim stiffening to stitching line and
blend edge of lining. Press. Turn
band right side out and press. Slip-stitch
lining to band at opening.</p>
<p>Sew small bone rings or very narrow
fabric loops at ends of band.
These loop over a hook fastened to
side of window.</p>
<h4>Anchoring Draperies</h4>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p17b.jpg" alt="uncaptioned" width="362" height="424" />
</div>
<p>Outside edges of draperies should
hang against the wall in a straight
taut line. Sew a plastic ring to the
bottom hem. Place a cup hook in
the wall or the baseboard in line
with the hem.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
